# Kmeans-Clustering

This is a programming project that I did for one of my courses. The objective is as explained below.

Objective(s):

Activision are planning on developing a new game. They want to study the market before developing the game to know about the expected response the game recieves. They want to confirm that before the game goes into development, the game will be widely recieved by users as well as critics. They also want to know the potential rating the game could receive from Critics as well as Users based on the fact that it would fall in the Action Adventure genre.

Activision want us to study the sales of popular games and give them an estimate of how much of sale to expect globally as well as in North America and Europe-Japan. They would also like to  They would also like for us to find out how much potential rating the game would receive as critic and User score.

We have been provided with a dataset which contains data about sales of various top games till 2016. The dataset contains columns such as NAme of the game, year of Release, Critic Score, USer Score, Total Sales, North America Sales, Europe Sales and so on. It also has details about the Platform and Genre which will helpus in our analysis.

Note: I have used Activision just as an example to make it seem authentic. The project has no relevance or is not made for commercial purposes nor has any kind of affiliation with Activision. It is my own original work.
